**Information on Clinical Trial Protocol Template**

This protocol template has been designed primarily for Clinical Trials which
require a Clinical Trial Certificate (CTC) from HSA. Please refer to the
Medicines Act for the legislative definition of clinical trial (see Section 2 of
the Act, Interpretation) and medicinal product (Section 3). A CTC is not only
required for unregistered medicinal products, but also for clinical trials on
locally registered medicinal products.

This template serves as a guide for all investigators. However, it is not
mandatory to use this template, provided that an alternative GCP-compliant
protocol is used. All advisory text is highlighted. These should all be deleted
before finalising the document. All sample text is in ‘basic text’ style.

>   Give a brief description of the drug/device to be studied whether currently
>   in use and approved for use and their mechanism of action.

>   Include a description and justification for the route of administration,
>   dosage, dosage regimen, intervention periods, and selection of study
>   population. Include a statement of hypothesis.

>   Study objectives are concise statements of the primary and secondary
>   clinical and statistical questions that the study is designed to answer.
>   Study hypothesis must relate to the hypothesis present in the rationale and
>   should be consistent with the objectives described. Number objectives in
>   order of priority. Include the primary endpoints and the secondary
>   endpoints, if any, to be measured during the trial.

>   State secondary protocol objectives if pertinent. This may or may not be
>   hypothesis driven, may include secondary outcomes, and may include more
>   general non-experimental objectives e.g. to develop a registry etc.

1.  The disease or disorder under study, and how it is to be documented i.e.
    diagnostic methods, criteria for classification etc.

2.  For populations with cancer or pre cancer please include requirements for
    histological confirmation of diagnosis, time for diagnosis and disease
    status at entry.

3.  Demographic characteristics (e.g. gender, age). Please explain age
    restrictions if any

>   Examples include the following: medical condition or laboratory finding that
>   precludes participation, recent (with time frame) illness that precludes or
>   delays participation, pregnancy or lactation, characteristics of household
>   or close contacts (e.g. household contacts who are immunocompromised), known
>   allergic reactions to components of study product(s), treatment with another

>   Describe “stopping rules” or “discontinuation criteria” for subjects/study.
>   List possible reasons for discontinuation of study intervention, e.g.
>   development of laboratory toxicities, study closure due to DSMB review etc.

### Discontinuation Visit and Procedures

>   Specify which of the evaluations required for the final study visit should
>   be done if withdrawal occurs. Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from
>   participation in the study at any time. Subjects may also withdraw
>   voluntarily from receiving the study intervention for any reason. Clearly
>   differentiate between what evaluations are to be done in each of these
>   circumstances.

>   If voluntary withdrawal occurs, the subject should be asked to continue
>   scheduled evaluations, complete an end of study evaluation, and be given
>   appropriate care under medical supervision until the symptoms of any adverse
>   event resolve or the subject’s condition becomes stable. Describe efforts to
>   continue follow - up, especially for safety outcome measures.

>   Information about the drugs could also be obtained from the I.B or the
>   package insert. Please include I.B or package insert.

>   A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence
>   that at any dose:

-   results in death

-   is life-threatening

-   requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing
    hospitalisation

-   results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or

-   is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

-   is a medical event that may jeopardize the patient and may require medical
    or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

>   Reporting timeline to CIRB:

-   SAE that result in death, regardless of causality, should be reported
    immediately - within 24 hours of the PI becoming aware of the event.

-   Local life-threatening (unexpected/ expected) SAE should be reported no
    later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator is aware of the event,
    followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar days.

-   Local unexpected SAE that are related events, but not life-threatening,
    should be reported no later than 15 calendar days after the investigator is
    aware of the event.

-   An increase in the rate of occurrence of local expected SAE, which is judged
    to be clinically important, should be reported within 15 calendar days after
    the PI is aware of the event.

-   Local expected SAE should be reported annually (together with Study Status
    Report for annual review).

-   Local unexpected and unlikely related SAE that are not life-threatening
    should also be reported annually (together with Study Status Report for
    annual review).

-   Local unexpected AE that are related events should be reported at least
    annually (together with Study Status Report for annual review).

-   Non-local unexpected SAE that are fatal or life threatening and
    definitely/probably/possibly related should be reported not later than 30
    calendar days after the PI is aware of the event.

>   The investigator is responsible for informing HSA no later than 15 calendar
>   days after first knowledge that the case qualifies for expedited reporting.
>   Follow-up information will be actively sought and submitted as it becomes
>   available. For fatal or life-threatening cases, HSA will be notified as soon
>   as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge that a
>   case qualifies, followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar
>   days.

1.  Describe the types of statistical interim analyses, including their timing.

>   The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring,
>   audits and/or IRB review and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct
>   access to source data/document.

### **QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE**

>   Describe how data will be evaluated for adherence with the protocol and for
>   accuracy in relation to source documents. Describe who will be responsible
>   for the evaluation of data quality and how frequently this will be done.

>   If there is an independent data monitoring committee and/or trial steering
>   committee or equivalent, describe the role(s), frequency of meetings and
>   composition of the committee here.

### **ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

>   This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that
>   have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent
>   with the Singapore Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory
>   requirements.

>   This final study protocol, including the final version of the Patient
>   Information and Informed Consent Form, must be approved in writing by the
>   Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB) and regulatory approval from
>   Health Sciences Authority (HSA), prior to enrolment of any patient into the
>   study.

>   The principle investigator is responsible for informing the CIRB and HSA of
>   any amendments to the protocol or other study-related documents, as per
>   local requirement.

>   Identify different consent forms that are needed for the study (e.g.
>   screening, study participation, HIV screening, future use specimens, assent
>   from minors)
