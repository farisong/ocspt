**Instructions to User:**

1.  **The first change Sections where the text is italicized** represent instructions with some
    example text. All require complete customization for your study. Sections
    that may not apply to all protocols have italicized instructions highlighted
    in grey.

2.  **Sections and text that are in regular font** represent standard language.
    In general, these sections should be present in your final protocol and the
    language should not be changed. However, every protocol is unique and
    changes to standard sections and language may be necessary to meet the needs
    of your protocol. Please review the language carefully to make sure that it
    is accurate for your study.

3.  **Sections that are highlighted in grey, but that have regular font,**
    represent sections or information that needs to be customized as applicable
    to your study, but the language that is present is generally considered to
    be standard if that section (or procedure) applies to your protocol.

4.  As you customize each section of the protocol, **remove the highlighting and
    restore the font to regular (from italics)** to denote that section as
    having been completed.

5.  When your protocol is complete, **review** it to ensure that all
    highlighting and italics have been removed.

3.2 Adverse event reporting 
----------------------------

### 3.2.1 Adverse event definitions

**Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE):** Any serious adverse effect on
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational
plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

**Associated with the investigational device:** There is a reasonable
possibility that the adverse effect may have been caused by the investigational
device.

**Life-threatening adverse effect:** Any adverse effect that places the subject,
in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, at immediate risk of
death from the effect **as it occurred**. It does not include a reaction that,
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

**Serious adverse effect:** An adverse effect is considered “serious” if, in the
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the
following outcomes:

-   death

-   a life-threatening AE

-   inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

-   a persistent or significant disability/incapacity

-   a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

    **Unanticipated adverse effect:** Any adverse effect, the nature,
    specificity, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with the risk
    information in the clinical study protocol or elsewhere in the current IDE
    application.

### 3.2.2 Eliciting adverse effect information

Clinical study subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse effects at
study visits.

### 3.2.3 Recording and assessment of adverse effects

All observed or volunteered adverse effects (serious or non-serious) and
abnormal test findings, regardless of treatment group, if applicable, or
suspected causal relationship to the investigational device or, if applicable,
other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be recorded in the subjects’
case histories. For all adverse effects, sufficient information will be pursued
and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of
the effect (i.e., whether the effect should be classified as a *serious adverse
effect*) and; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse
effect and the investigational device or, if applicable, the other study
treatment or diagnostic product(s).

Adverse effects or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the
investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic
product(s) will be followed until the effect (or its sequelae) or the abnormal
test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the
sponsor-investigator.

### 3.2.4 Abnormal test findings

An abnormal test finding will be classified as an *adverse effect* if one or
more of the following criteria are met:

-   The test finding is accompanied by clinical symptoms

-   The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or
    medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional concomitant
    drug or other therapy (Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence
    of any of the other listed criteria, does not constitute an adverse effect.)

-   The test finding leads to a change in study dosing or exposure or
    discontinuation of subject participation in the clinical study

    -   The test finding is considered an adverse effect by the
        sponsor-investigator

### 3.2.5 Causality and severity assessment

The sponsor-investigator will promptly review documented adverse effects and
abnormal test findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be
classified as an adverse effect; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that
the adverse effect was caused by the investigational device or other study
treatments; and 3) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a *serious
adverse effect*.

If the sponsor-investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and
of questionable relationship to the investigational device or other study
treatments,” the adverse effect will be classified as *associated with the use
of the investigational device or other study treatments* for reporting purposes.
If the sponsor-investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown but
not related to the investigational device or other study treatments,” this
determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the
respective subject’s case history.

### 3.2.6 Reporting adverse effects to the FDA

For any observed or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be a UADE,
the sponsor-investigator will submit an expedited safety report to the FDA’s
Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The expedited safety report will
consist of:

-   a completed *Form* [FDA
    3500A](http://www.fda.gov/opacom/morechoices/fdaforms/3500Aes.pdf)

-   a cover letter analyzing the significance of the event

A copy of this safety report will be provided to all participating study
investigators.

The completed *Form* [FDA
3500A](http://www.fda.gov/opacom/morechoices/fdaforms/3500Aes.pdf) and cover
letter will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later
than 10 working days after the sponsor-investigator first receives notice of the
adverse effect.

If, following receipt and investigation of follow-up information regarding an
adverse effect that was previously determined not to be a UADE, the
sponsor-investigator determines that the event does meet the requirements for
expedited reporting, the sponsor-investigator will submit a completed
[Form](http://www.fda.gov/opacom/morechoices/fdaforms/3500Aes.pdf) and cover
letter as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days, after
the determination is made.

Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed [FDA Form
3500A](http://www.fda.gov/opacom/morechoices/fdaforms/3500Aes.pdf), the
sponsor-investigator will submit additional information concerning the reported
adverse effect as requested by the FDA.

### 3.2.5 Reporting adverse effects to the responsible IRB

For any adverse event determined to be a UADE, the sponsor-investigator will
submit the completed *Form* [FDA
3500A](http://www.fda.gov/opacom/morechoices/fdaforms/3500Aes.pdf) and cover
letter to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 10 working
days after the sponsor-investigator first receives notice of the adverse effect.

Follow-up information to reported adverse effects will be submitted to the IRB
as soon as the relevant information is available.

3.3 Withdrawal of subjects due to adverse effects
-------------------------------------------------

*Specify the criteria and procedures for withdrawing subjects from continued
exposure to the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment
or diagnostic product(s) due to an observed or volunteered adverse effect; to
include the type and timing of data to be collected from withdrawn subjects.*

*Specify if subjects withdrawn from study participation due to an adverse effect
will be replaced and, if so, the corresponding procedures for their
replacement.*

4.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE
=============================================

*Provide a description of each important component, ingredient or element,
property, and principle of operation of the investigational device.*

*If applicable, describe any anticipated changes in the device during the
investigation. If no changes to the device are anticipated, state this.*

5.0 MONITORING PROCEDURES
=========================

Independent monitoring of the study for compliance with the clinical protocol
and with IDE regulations will be conducted periodically (at a minimum, annually)
by qualified staff of [institution]. The address of the [monitoring group] is
listed below. Monitoring procedures of the [monitoring group] are listed on the
[group] website at:

[list contact information]

The sponsor-investigator and the [institution] will permit direct access of the
study monitors and appropriate regulatory authorities to the study data and to
the corresponding source data and documents to verify the accuracy of this data.

*Describe the nature and timing of any quality control/quality assurance reviews
(independent of the previously described monitoring activities) that will be
undertaken by the sponsor-investigator to ensure appropriate conduct of the
clinical study and quality and completeness of the accrued study data. Describe
the data and safety monitoring plan for the clinical study as outlined in the
IRB application.*

6.0 LABELING
============

*Provide copies of all labeling for the device.*

The labeling will contain the statement "CAUTION - Investigational Device.
Limited by Federal (or United States) Law to Investigational Use." [§
812.5(a))].

7.0 INFORMED CONSENT
====================

Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human
Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local
regulations.

The Sponsor-Investigator will prepare the informed consent form and HIPAA
authorization and provide the documents to IRB for approval. The written consent
document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the
International Conference on Harmonisation and will also comply with local
regulations. The Sponsor-Investigator will retain an IRB-approved copy of the
Informed Consent Form in the study master file.

A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from each
subject prior to entering the subject into the trial. Information should be
given in both oral and written form and subjects (or their legal
representatives) must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the
study. If a subject is unable to sign the informed consent form (ICF) and the
HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the subject. A copy of
the signed consent form will be given to the subject or legal representative of
the subject and the original will be maintained with the subject’s records.

8.0 IRB INFORMATION
===================

The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by the IRB of each
participating center prior to study initiation. UADEs will be reported to the
IRB in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the
IRB, and the Investigator will keep the IRB informed as to the progress of the
study. The Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB compliance with
regulations.

Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as
protocol, protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms,
information concerning patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures,
or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the IRB. The IRB’s written
unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form will
be in the possession of the Investigator before the study is initiated. The
IRB’s unconditional approval statement will be transmitted by the Investigator
to the Sponsor or designee prior to the shipment of study supplies to the site.
This approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and number and
should identify the documents reviewed and the date of review.

Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated
without prior written IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate
hazards to the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or
administrative aspects of the study. Such modifications will be submitted to the
IRB and written verification that the modification was submitted and
subsequently approved should be obtained.

The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted
for review; new information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients
of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re-approval;
and when the study has been completed.
